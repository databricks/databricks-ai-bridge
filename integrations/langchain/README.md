# ðŸ¦œðŸ”— Using Databricks AI Bridge with Langchain

Integrate Databricks AI Bridge package with Langchain to allow seamless usage of Databricks AI features with Langchain/Langgraph applications.

Note: This repository is the future home for all Databricks integrations currently found in langchain-databricks and langchain-community. Over time, weâ€™ll be consolidating integrations here, including ChatDatabricks, DatabricksEmbeddings, DatabricksVectorSearch, and more.

Stay tuned for updates on when each integration becomes available in this package. For now, you can continue using langchain-databricks until the transition is complete.
