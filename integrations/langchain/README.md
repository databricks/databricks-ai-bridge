# ðŸ¦œðŸ”— Using Databricks AI Bridge with Langchain

Integrate Databricks AI Bridge package with Langchain to allow seamless usage of Databricks AI features with Langchain/Langgraph applications.

Note: This repository is the future home for all Databricks integrations currently found in `langchain-databricks` and `langchain-community`. We have now aliased `langchain-databricks` to `databricks-langchain`, consolidating integrations such as ChatDatabricks, DatabricksEmbeddings, DatabricksVectorSearch, and more under this package.

## Installation

```sh
pip install databricks-langchain
```

### Install from source
