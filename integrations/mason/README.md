# `databricks-mason`

Mason is an experimental CLI for Databricks custom agent preview APIs and
deployments. It manages memory, sessions, tracing, and deployments from one
authenticated command.

> The underlying APIs are in preview and may need workspace enablement.

## Installation

From PyPI:

```sh
pip install databricks-mason
```

From source:

```sh
pip install 'git+https://github.com/databricks/databricks-ai-bridge.git#subdirectory=integrations/mason'
```

For tracing commands, install Mason with tracing extras:

```sh
pip install 'databricks-mason[tracing]'
```

## Authentication

Mason uses [Databricks authentication](https://docs.databricks.com/aws/en/dev-tools/cli/authentication).
If you do not already have credentials, authenticate a named profile first. You can
then ask Mason to validate and remember that profile:

```sh
databricks auth login --profile <profile>
mason login --profile <profile>
mason sessions stores list
```

`mason login` does not create credentials; it stores the selected profile in
`~/.mason/config.json`. `mason logout` forgets that selection without revoking the
underlying credentials. If Databricks SDK default authentication is already configured,
you can skip `mason login`. You can also pass `--profile/-p` for an individual command.
Use `--output json` for scripting.

## Commands

mason [-p <profile>] [-o text|json]
